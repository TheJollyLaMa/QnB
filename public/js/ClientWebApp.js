- quests are meant to reward members for their interest in educating themselves on DAO activity
    and so must be designed to capture their learning inspiration for reasonable amounts of time
    while offer a reward large enough to help them feel relaxed while learning.

- bounties are designed to utilize and expand the skillsets of community members to improve the codebase,
  documentation, community outreach, or other activities deemed necessary for organizational improvement.

The Hitchhikers Creed:
you want less than 5 employees.  You can do it with 1.  2-3 is ideal.
you want 2 or more 'robots' working for you.
they should be managing/monitoring your energy, water, food, and climate.
With those basic needs being monitored for you by your team,
you can start focussing on how you are going to efficiently support that team
you have to learn to code or communicate with the coders that are out there in their languages (github,charts,basic programming lingo)
From there,
copy gitcoins dao model
bounty out whatever you need done next and ration out your rewards while incentivising education on the mission through quests
take feedback from the community in polls and votes
circulate a currency and memorabilia
reach out to help a friend put their mask on. or finally take it off cuz you can properly isolate.
